Favicons are the icons that symbolize your web app. Due to a long history of non-standardized implementations, there's a list of boxes to check to make sure your app is representing itself properly in various contexts.

I started with a single, 512x512 pixel PNG image that looked like this:

<Image alt="favicon" src="/static/images/logo512.png" width={256} height={256} />

Then I fed it to the generator at https://realfavicongenerator.net/.

It walks you through what's wrong, and what to change to fix it. Give it a try!
