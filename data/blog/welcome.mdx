# Welcome! Blog's up.

I intend for this blog to be where I chronicle progress on all things Etherion. So with that in mind, let's cover what's been happening to get this blog off the ground!

- Started with the [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
- Upgraded all dependencies to latest.
- Resolved a number of breaking changes.
  - **Fix for issue where contentlayer-generated files weren't being built during deploy.**
  - **Fix for crashing app in production.**
    At some point since the starter was last updated, contentlayer started inlining the ReactDOM runtime
    in order to workaround another issue. However, the starter blog was using the Preact runtime in production
    and now we had a conflict between the React and Preact internals. I fixed it by just removing Preact.
  - **Fix for hydration error.**
    Date formatting timezone needed to be explicitly set for server/client rendering consistency.
- Now using React Suspense for loading blog posts.
- Various Eslint & Prettier fixes.
- Installed a different Prism theme for code blocks.
  - _My feeling is that it needs more blue..._

```tsx
# Check it out
const Wrapper = ({ layout, content, ...rest }: MDXLayout) => {
  const Layout = lazy(() => import(`../layouts/${layout}`))
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<>Loading...</>}>
      <Layout content={content} {...rest} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

- Set up production deploy with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Added `react-tweet` package for embedded Twitter posts that can be used in blog entries.

- Inserted my own contact info.
- Inserted my own branding content and favicon configuration.
  - Fixes for starter blog favicon and site metadata misconfiguration.
- Set up analytics. ðŸ‘€
- Fixes for Content Security Policy issues.
- Installed [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) (formerly Netlify CMS) for editing blog posts.
  - _Noted issue where the admin page isn't mobile optimized. [See related Github issue here.](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/issues/441#issuecomment-1321010883)_
  - Configured to work with MDX files (Markdown + React).
- _Noted some contentlayer type warnings on blog posts._
- Set up dedicated [email address](mailto:azaeres@etherion.app) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/EtherionExp) for the Etherion Project.

## Next Up

- Porting the [Etherion app prototype](https://latest.etherion.app/) from Create React App to Next.js.
