summary: I've open sourced the parallax library!
---

[I've open sourced the parallax library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-react-parallax), because it's awesome, and it seems to be an itch many Pixijs devs want scratched. It's been up for a few days, and already has over a hundred downloads.

A demonstration of the parallax effect is up at the [Etherion Lab](https://lab.etherion.app/experiment1).
